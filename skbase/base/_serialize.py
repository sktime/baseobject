"""Utilities for serializing and deserializing objects.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT FOR DEVELOPERS:
Do not add estimator specific functionality to the `load` utility.
All estimator specific functionality should be in
the class methods `load_from_serial` and `load_from_path`.

def load(serial):
    """Load an object either from in-memory object or from a file location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    serial : serialized container (tuple), str (path), or Path object (reference)
        if serial is a tuple (serialized container):
            Contains two elements, first in-memory metadata and second
            the related object.
        if serial is a string (path reference):
            The name of the file without the extension, for e.g: if the file
            is `estimator.zip`, `serial='estimator'`. It can also represent a
            path, for eg: if location is `home/stored/models/estimator.zip`
            then `serial='home/stored/models/estimator'`.
        if serial is a Path object (path reference):
            `serial` then points to the `.zip` file into which the
            object was stored using class method `.save()` of an estimator.

    Returns
    -------
    Deserialized self resulting in output `serial`, of `cls.save`
