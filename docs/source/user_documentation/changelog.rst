[0.6.1] - 2023-10-26
====================

Highlights
----------

* ``set_params`` now recognizes unique suffixes as aliases
  for full parameter strings, e.g., ``foo`` instead of
  ``estimator__component__foo`` (:pr:`229`) :user:`fkiraly`
* the ``deep_equals`` utility now admits custom plugins with dependency
  isolation, e.g., for data types such as ``dask`` or ``polars``
  (:pr:`238`) :user:`fkiraly`

  (:pr:`228`) :user:`fkiraly`

[0.4.3] - 2023-05-04
====================

Hotfix for accidental import of ``pytest`` through ``BaseObject.clone``,
including test for ``pytest`` dependency isolation.

Contents
--------

[0.4.2] - 2023-05-02
====================

Maintenance update that cleans up dependencies.

Notably, ``scikit-base`` no longer has any core dependencies.

This is as per usage intention as a base module,
therefore this removal is not accompanied by deprecation.

Dependency changes
------------------

* ``scikit-learn``, ``typing-extensions``, and ``pytest`` are no longer
  core dependencies.
  ``pytest`` remains a dependency in ``dev`` and ``test`` dependency sets.
* ``scikit-learn`` is now part of the ``dev`` and ``test`` dependency sets,
  as it is required to test compatibility with ``scikit-learn``
* a dependency conflict has been resolved in the ``docs`` dependency set for
  the docs build,
  by pinning versions

Maintenance

* [MNT] remove dependency on ``typing-extensions`` (:pr:`167`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove dependency on ``pytest`` (:pr:`168`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove dependency on ``scikit-learn`` (:pr:`171`) :user:`fkiraly`
