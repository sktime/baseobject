[0.7.5] - 2024-03-02
====================

Small hotfix release.

Contents
--------

* [BUG] fix ``deep_equals`` on objects which have ``__len__`` but ``len(obj)``
  causes exception (:pr:`303`) :user:`fkiraly`


[0.7.4] - 2024-03-01
====================

Small hotfix release.

Contents
--------

* [BUG] preserve exception type raised by ``get_test_params``
  (:pr:`300`) :user:`fkiraly`


[0.7.3] - 2024-02-29
====================

Feature and bugfix release.

Core interface changes
----------------------

* ``all_objects`` now allows filtering for arbitrary parent classes, not just classes
  inheriting from ``BaseObject``. This is useful for looking up objects in a third
  party package that are not part of the ``skbase`` hierarchy.


Enhancements
------------

* [ENH] allow arbitrary base class in ``all_objects`` (:pr:`284`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [ENH] improved exception feedback for test instance generation methods
  of ``BaseObject`` (:pr:`286`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [ENH] estimator soft dependency check utilities (:pr:`285`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [ENH] Refactor ``BaseObject.clone`` (:pr:`281`) :user:`tpvasconcelos`

Fixes
-----

* [BUG] Fix ``deep_equals`` for ``pandas.Index`` of different length
  (:pr:`290`) :user:`MBristle`

Documentation
-------------

* [DOC] remove accidental duplicated section in ``get_test_params``
  docstring (:pr:`292`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [DOC] add yarnabrina to ``all-contributorsrc`` (:pr:`294`) :user:`fkiraly`

Maintenance
-----------

* [MNT] add ``codecov` config ``yml``, remove CI failure condition
  (:pr:`296`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove unnecessary CI triggers for release branches (:pr:`298`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate by (:pr:`289`) :user:`@pre-commit-ci`

  (:pr:`283`) :user:`dependabot`
* [MNT] [Dependabot](deps): Bump pre-commit/action from ``3.0.0`` to ``3.0.1``

[0.7.2] - 2024-01-31
====================

Feature and bugfix release.

Core interface changes
----------------------

* all ``BaseObject`` descendants now possess a method ``set_random_state``.
  This can be used for nested setting of ``random_state`` variables,
  and is useful for ensuring reproducibility in nested estimators.
  (:pr:`268`) :user:`fkiraly`
* ``all_objects`` now supports filtering for list-valued tags in ``filter_tags``
  as a convenience feature.
  When the query value is a single value or a list, the filter condition is
  that the tag value and the query value have at least one element in common.
  (:pr:`273`) :user:`fkiraly`

Enhancements
------------

* [ENH] ``all_objects`` ``filter_tags`` to function with list-of tags
  (:pr:`273`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [ENH] Random state handling, ``set_random_state`` method (:pr:`268`) :user:`fkiraly`

Fixes
-----

* [BUG] Fix cloning of config for nested objects (:pr:`276`) :user:`tpvasconcelos`

* [MNT] [Dependabot](deps): Bump ``actions/dependency-review-action`` from 3 to 4
  (:pr:`269`) :user:`dependabot`
* [MNT] [Dependabot](deps-dev): Update ``sphinx-issues`` requirement
  from ``<4.0.0`` to ``<5.0.0`` (:pr:`271`) :user:`dependabot`
* [MNT] [Dependabot](deps): Bump styfle/cancel-workflow-action
  from ``0.12.0`` to ``0.12.1`` (:pr:`272`) :user:`dependabot`
* [MNT] Add common IDE files to ``.gitignore`` (:pr:`277`) :user:`tpvasconcelos`

[0.7.1] - 2023-01-12
====================

Minor bugfix and maintenance release.

Contents
--------

* [BUG] fix ``deep_equals`` for ``np.array`` with ``dtype="object"``
  (:pr:`263`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [pre-commit.ci] pre-commit autoupdate (:pr:`264`) :user:`precommit-ci`


[0.7.0] - 2023-01-03
====================

Bugfix release with potentially breaking changes related to
``set_config``, ``get_config`` (:pr:`257`, :pr:`259`, :user:`fkiraly`)
due to masking of third party bugs,
please consult the changelog for details in case of breakage.

Core interface changes
----------------------

* configuration values - set via ``set_config`` and inspectable via ``get_config`` -
  are now retained through ``clone`` and ``reset``.
  Previous behaviour was to reset configuration values to default,
  which is considered a bug. However, this change may break existing code
  if two errors cancel out, e.g.,
  if a breaking (without bug) configuration was set, the reset through the bug.
  In this case, the bug masked the breaking configuration, which should be addressed.
  Most breakages over 0.6.2 should be addressable by removing ``set_config`` calls,
  i.e., removing the genuinely breaking configuration.
* A configuration field ``clone_config`` was added that allows to configure
  whether ``clone`` should clone the configuration.
  This is useful for meta-estimators that
  should not clone the configuration of their components.
  This change is not breaking - considered in difference to the above - as
  the default behaviour is to clone the configuration.

Fixes
-----

* [BUG] fix ``deep_equals`` plugin for ``pd.Index`` (:pr:`260`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [BUG] retain config at ``reset``, add tests for ``set_config``, ``get_config``
  (:pr:`259`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [BUG] retain config after ``clone``, add config to configure whether to clone config
  (:pr:`257`) :user:`fkiraly`

  relaxation of ``MultiIndex`` equality check (:pr:`246`) :user:`fkiraly`

Fixes
-----

* [BUG] ensure ``deep_equals`` plugins are passed on to all recursions

  isolation, e.g., for data types such as ``dask`` or ``polars``

* ``dependabot`` is now enabled for the ``skbase`` repository
  (:pr:`228`) :user:`fkiraly`
