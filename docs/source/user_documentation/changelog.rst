[0.4.3] - 2023-05-04
====================

Hotfix for accidental import of ``pytest`` through ``BaseObject.clone``,
including test for ``pytest`` dependency isolation.

Contents
--------

* [BUG] turn off check in ``BaseObject.clone`` (:pr:`176`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] test for isolation of developer dependencies,
  and basic ``pytest``-less test for ``BaseObject`` (:pr:`179`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [DOC] fix some broken doc links, linting (:pr:`175`) :user:`fkiraly`


[0.4.2] - 2023-05-02
====================

Maintenance update that cleans up dependencies.

Notably, ``scikit-base`` no longer has any core dependencies.

This is as per usage intention as a base module,
therefore this removal is not accompanied by deprecation.

Dependency changes
------------------

* ``scikit-learn``, ``typing-extensions``, and ``pytest`` are no longer
  core dependencies.
  ``pytest`` remains a dependency in ``dev`` and ``test`` dependency sets.
* ``scikit-learn`` is now part of the ``dev`` and ``test`` depency sets,
  as it is required to test compatibility with ``scikit-learn``
* a dependency conflict has been resolved in the ``docs`` dependency set for
  the docs build,
  by pinning versions

Maintenance
-----------

* [MNT] remove dependency on ``typing-extensions`` (:pr:`167`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove dependency on ``pytest`` (:pr:`168`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove dependency on ``scikit-learn`` (:pr:`171`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] add ``scikit-learn`` to ``test`` dependency set (:pr:`172`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] remove ``fail-fast`` flag in CI (:pr:`169`) :user:`fkiraly`
* [MNT] resolve dependency conflict in ``docs`` dependency
  set (:pr:`173`) :user:`fkiraly`


[0.4.1] - 2023-04-26
====================

Small bugfix patch for pydata 2023 Seattle notebooks.

Fixes
-----

* [BUG] fix html display for meta-objects (:pr:`160`) :user:`fkiraly`
